Developers Challenge:

1.First Problem: When a minion is trying to do damage or do something to an enemy minion nothing happens. The problem is in function
destroy_creature_from_player. How can you fix this ?

Steps to reproduce the bug:
- set difficulty to easy
- play with the power of the people deck, your opponent can have any deck and click start game
- hit the button new hand until you get "Bailiff" card
- hit end turn button until you get to have 3 mana so you can play the card
- play the card and target an enemy card see that the card is not changing the attack to 1

2.Second Problem: When you use a spell that damages all minions (it has ALL in description) if the spell does 0 damage the creatures
they still lose the Armored attribute, why ? How can you fix this ? The problem is in general_spells from game_logics file.

Steps to reproduce the bug:
- set difficulty to easy
- play with the roman legions deck , your opponent should play with guards of byzantium and click start game
- hit the button new hand until you get "Unknown Territory"
- hit end turn button until you get to have at least 3 mana so you can play the card and the opponent has an armored card
- use the card while you have no defences and see that the armored minion no longer has the grey outline

3.Third Problem:The same steps as on top but this time you need defences on you so play anything that gives defence and then
use the "Unknown Territory" card. The card says that you need to spend all your defences but you still have all defences
why ? How to fix this ? The problem is in player file at check_kingdom

4.Fourth Problem:If you select modes from the main page you will see some mode options if you try to pick any of them execept the
I hate myself option you will always play i hate myself. Why ? How to fix this ? The problem is in modes file.
