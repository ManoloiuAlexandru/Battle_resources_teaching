Developers Challenge:

1.First Problem: When a minion is trying to do damage or do something to an enemy minion nothing happens. The problem is in function
destroy_creature_from_player. How can you fix this ?

Steps to reproduce the bug:
- set difficulty to easy
- play with the power of the people deck, your opponent can have any deck and click start game
- hit the button new hand until you get "Bailiff" card
- hit end turn button until you get to have 3 mana so you can play the card
- play the card and target an enemy card, see that the card is not changing the attack to 1

2.Second Problem: When you use a spell that damages all minions (it has ALL in description) if the spell does 0 damage the creatures
they still lose the Armored attribute, why ? How can you fix this ? The problem is in general_spells from game_logics file.

Steps to reproduce the bug:
- set difficulty to easy
- play with the roman legions deck , your opponent should play with guards of byzantium and click start game
- hit the button new hand until you get "Unknown Territory"
- hit end turn button until you get to have at least 3 mana so you can play the card and the opponent has an armored card
- use the card while you have no defences and see that the armored minion no longer has the grey outline

3.Third Problem:The same steps as on top but this time you need defences on you so play anything that gives defence and then
use the "Unknown Territory" card. The card says that you need to spend all your defences but you still have all defences
why ? How to fix this ? The problem is in player file at check_kingdom

4.Fourth Problem:If you select modes from the main page you will see some mode options if you try to pick any of them execept the
I hate myself option you will always play i hate myself. Why ? How to fix this ? The problem is in modes file.

5.Fifth Problem:Card Charles V (holy roman empire) has a checker that looks if your deck (AT THE TIME YOU ARE PLAYING THE CARD)
has cards only from the holy_roman_empire but no matter if you make your deck with full roman empire cards or with a full no roman
empire cards he will not trigger his ability to gain Rush Guard etc. why ? The problem is in player file at check_kingdom method.

6.When using a card that checks your hand for example  "Knight Recruiter" it will check if you have a knight in your hand but if you have a knight
in your hand and recruit it, the second time you use the  "Knight Recruiter" it will still let you recruit a knight, aldo you
don't hold a knight in your hand. Why ? How to fix this ?
Steps to reproduce:
- make a personal deck and put  "Knight Recruiter"X2 and a knight, any knight will do
- set the game to easy
- play the  "Knight Recruiter" while holding a knight
- recruit the knight you have then play the rest of the knights
- when you play  "Knight Recruiter" again it will let you recruit aldo your hand has no knight

7.When the bot has a card that buff he will pick a card from his board aldo he can't buff the card:
Steps to reproduce:
- make a personal deck and put any card that can buff other cards and then put "Nero"(you need to be roman empire)(put 10 cards)
- pick mode I hate myself and start game
- Play the game until the bot puts Nero on the board see that the first creature gets +6 attack why ?
The problem is in bot file at line 133

8.When you use "Knock down" spell on a minion with Armored the minion will lose the Armored attribute after the effect is
over. Why? How can you fix this ?
The problem is in game_logics.
Steps to reproduce:
- Make a deck and put  "Knock down" spell or any card that has the  "Knock down" effect
- make bot pick power of the people deck
- pick easy mode then start game and hit new hand until you get  "Knock down" in your hand
- when the bot puts an armored down hit it with the  "Knock down" spell then hit end turn until the card has other boarder
- see that the boarder is not silver anymore.
Find the line and come up with a suggestion to fix.

Ongoing Homework: find a bug, report it with steps on how to reproduce it
Bonus if you want to tell me what file has the problem.
Extra bonus: fix the bug and show me what you did.

Tips for testing:
The "I hate myself" option from the modes tab is very usefull when you want to check if the bot is playing the cards correct
If the server runs in an error just stop the server close the web and restart the server and the reopen the website
